            "details": "Roche is the world’s largest biotech company, a global pioneer in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. I joined Roche in 2013 as a <strong>Full Stack developer</strong> doing <strong>AngularJS development</strong> on the frontend and <strong>Java</strong> on the backend. From the very begining I have to learn how to work in distributed <strong>agile teams</strong> using agile processes like <strong>Scrum</strong>, <strong>Kanban</strong> with continuous improvement in continuous integration environment. During the four years of working for the company I was involved in development of several projects i.e. </p><p><strong>Risk assessment and categorization tool</strong> that allows teams to assess the study risks, plan risk mitigation, and review of critical data and processes. It was one of the first polyglot platform with <strong>Microservices Architecture</strong> implemented in Roche. Fully asynchronous event driven communication with <strong>WebSockets</strong>. System was implemented and successfully released to Production using pure Scrum methodology. CI and CD in place, as well as one-click deployment to Production environment.</p><p><strong>Web interface</strong> for SharePoint (Microsoft’s document management and storage system), that allows the user to upload, edit, label and search for documents across multiple SharePoints sites.</p><p><strong>Tracking tool</strong> it is a kind of <strong>JIRA</strong> product, where users can define and track certain activities. Every activity consists of a set of fields which define tracked content. For instance, to track your client’s complaint, first you have to define what kind of fields your activity should consist of. This part of the system  is called “definition”. After definition is complete, complaint activity based on this definition can be created. Now tracking new complaint is possible, user can fill in all created fields with data, set status of the complaint and do other actions.</p><p>System for gathering information about Roche's associates. Typical <strong>CRUD</strong> application.",
